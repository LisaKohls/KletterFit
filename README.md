# MAD 2 - FitnessWarrior

## Project Abstract

Our Fitness App contains of two sections. The first one is supposed to help you to keep track with your trainings. It allows you to get inspiration for new trainings and creating individual trainings. Each training has several workout options which are all saved in a database. You can see statistics that analyse your behaviour and progress and you can set progress goals.
The second sections is dedicated to climbing. You can see which level you are currently climbing, which routes you are working on and adding individual routes.
